## ✏️ What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a **basic visual guide** that represents the **layout and structure** of a website, app, or interface. Think of it as a **blueprint** 🏗️ — it outlines what goes where before any real design or coding begins.

Wireframes are typically:
- 🟦 Low-fidelity (simple boxes and lines)
- 🎯 Focused on functionality, not colors or branding
- 🧭 Used to define navigation, structure, and flow

## 💡 Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is a **critical step** in the design workflow because it:

✅ Helps you visualize the structure before committing to design  
✅ Saves time and resources by catching issues early  
✅ Improves communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders  
✅ Acts as a roadmap for UI/UX decisions

## 👨‍🎨 Who Uses Wireframes?

- UX/UI Designers 🎨  
- Developers 👨‍💻  
- Product Managers 📋  
- Clients 🤝

Everyone benefits from a clear wireframe — it’s the **bridge between concept and creation**.

## 🧱 Key Elements of a Wireframe

A good wireframe includes several foundational elements that work together to create a strong user experience. Here's a breakdown:

### 🗂️ Layout Structure

Defines **how the page is divided** — for example, using grids or sections.  
🧾 *Example:* A homepage with a **3-column layout**: sidebar, content area, and ads.

> 📌 Helps ensure content is organized and easy to scan.

---

### 🧭 Navigation

Shows **where menus, links, and buttons** will be placed for users to move around the app or site.  
🧾 *Example:* A **top navbar** with links to Home, About, and Contact pages.

> 📌 Helps users find their way and improves usability.

---

### 📝 Content Placement

Indicates **where text, images, and key messages** will go.  
🧾 *Example:* A hero section with a **headline, subtext, and a call-to-action button**.

> 📌 Ensures important content gets the attention it deserves.

---

### ⚙️ Functionality

Outlines **interactive components** like forms, sliders, or modals — even if they're not yet clickable.  
🧾 *Example:* A login form with **email and password fields** plus a "Submit" button.

> 📌 Helps visualize user actions and how the interface will behave.
