## ✏️ What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a **basic visual guide** that represents the **layout and structure** of a website, app, or interface. Think of it as a **blueprint** 🏗️ — it outlines what goes where before any real design or coding begins.

Wireframes are typically:
- 🟦 Low-fidelity (simple boxes and lines)
- 🎯 Focused on functionality, not colors or branding
- 🧭 Used to define navigation, structure, and flow

## 💡 Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is a **critical step** in the design workflow because it:

✅ Helps you visualize the structure before committing to design  
✅ Saves time and resources by catching issues early  
✅ Improves communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders  
✅ Acts as a roadmap for UI/UX decisions
